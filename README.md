💳 Online Payments Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

Online payments are widely used today, but they also face the risk of fraud. Fraudulent transactions can cause major financial losses for banks, businesses, and customers. Detecting fraud quickly and accurately is very important.

This project uses Machine Learning to identify whether an online transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. The system analyzes transaction data such as amount, type, and other features to detect suspicious patterns.

The model is trained on historical transaction data and learns to distinguish between normal and fraudulent behavior.

🎯 Objective

To build a model that can detect fraudulent online transactions.

To improve security in digital payment systems.

To reduce financial losses caused by fraud.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

🧠 How It Works

Load and explore the dataset

Clean and preprocess the data

Train machine learning models

Evaluate model performance

Predict whether a transaction is fraud or not

🚀 Outcome

The final system can automatically detect suspicious transactions and help improve online payment security.
